Welcome to **Tissue**, a Python static site generator.

This file serves both as the project documentation *and* a rendered page in the site.

- Files go in `source/`
- Templates in `templates/`
- Static assets in `static/`

Set `exclude: true` in frontmatter to skip a file during navigation or page loops.
